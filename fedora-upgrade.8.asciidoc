NAME
----
fedora-upgrade - tool to guide you with upgrade of Fedora to next major version using dnf.


SYNOPSIS
--------
*fedora-upgrade* [--help] [--tmpfs=SIZE] [--upgrade-to=VERSION]


DESCRIPTION
-----------

Script *fedora-upgrade* tries to automate steps needed for dnf-upgrade from one major version to next one.

Steps which fedora-upgrade does:

* Display usual warnings.
* Check dependencies.
* Resolve old .rpmsave and .rpmnew files before upgrading (if there are some).
* Download and import RPM GPG keys.
* Run "dnf --releasever=$TOVER distro-sync".
* Install missing packages from group 'Minimal Install'.
* Resolve old .rpmsave and .rpmnew files after upgrade.
* Reset priorities of services.

--tmpfs=SIZE - When performing online upgrade and you have small /var/cache/dnf then this option will mount /var/cache/dnf as tmpfs with specified size. The SIZE can be anything what accepts `mount` command. E.g. "3G". The mount point is unmounted when dnf finishes.

-u=VERSION, --upgrade-to=VERSION - By default `fedora-upgrade` upgrade to next version. I.e. from 29 to 30. You can specify to which version you are going to upgrade and upgrade from 28 to 30. Be warned that this is hardly tested and there can be some issues. The VERSION is a number or string "rawhide".
